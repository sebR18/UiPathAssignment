# UiPathAssignment
This is a simple one page website to collect a user email and invoke a UiPath automation. This automation will scrape Seahawks schedule from the Seahawks website, download it into a .CSV file and will send it to the user email provided. The email will come from my personal email account '12sebastian@gmail.com'.

The main file is 'index.html' and it uses UiPath JS SDK and 'utils.js' to activate the automation by name ("Generate.Seahawks.Schedule").

The UiPath automation project files are in the UiPath folder.

This is a small experimental assignment and there is no unit test coverage for this project. This can be added later if requested.
